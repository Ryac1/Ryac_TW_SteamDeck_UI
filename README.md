# v2.1:
This is a new release with the latest files i have been using.

Some changes i remember are:

- Added files/folders for the new PVP server (folder 'Turtle WoW' is PVP) 
- Hunter Pet frame is now correctly in position.
- Fixed some positioning of the right side buttons.
- Some minor issues i can't remember :)
- There is also a 2.1 controller layout now added under game name "World of Warcraft" in Steam with some minor tweaks
- Added specific character profiles for Hunter,Warrior,Rogue and Druid in WTF\Account\XXXXXXX\Nordanaar (PVE) and in WTF\Account\XXXXXXX\Turtle WoW (PVP), remember to rename these folders to your own character names, this will ensure the least amount of tweaking.
